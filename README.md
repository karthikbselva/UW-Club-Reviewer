# UW-Club-Reviewer

UW-Club-Reviewer is aimed to encourage Waterloo students to join clubs by making information and student opinion's on clubs more accessible. At the start of our university journey we saw that students at Waterloo were hesitant to join clubs or would have trouble finding information about them. With this project we hope that more students can find clubs that align with their interests.
